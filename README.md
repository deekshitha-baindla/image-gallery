## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔘 Category Filter
When a category button is clicked:
- JavaScript reads the button text
- Matches it with image class names
- Displays only matching images
- Hides others

### 🔎 Search Function
- Users type in the search box
- Images are filtered based on their category class name
- Results update instantly

## 📱 Responsive Design

Images automatically resize for smaller screens using media queries (max-width: 768px).
